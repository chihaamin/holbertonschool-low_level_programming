## üõ† Function Descriptions

### `int _putchar(char c)`
Writes a character to stdout.

### `ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters)`
Reads a text file and prints up to `letters` characters to stdout.

### `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
Creates a file and writes a string to it. Returns 1 on success, -1 on failure.

### `int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
Appends a string to the end of a file. Returns 1 on success, -1 on failure.

### `char *create_buffer(char *file)`
Allocates a 1024-byte buffer for file copying operations.

### `void close_file(int fd)`
Closes a file descriptor, handling errors.
